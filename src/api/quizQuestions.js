      question: "Does the novel coronavirus only seriously affects older people?",
      info:`While statistically older people are more severely affected that is skewed by the fact that 
	    they are part of the population that have pre-existing medical conditions. 
	    The fact here is that the COVID-19 affects anyone with pre-existing medical conditions.
	    People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and
	    people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease)
	    appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.
 	    WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus,
	    for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene.`,

      question: "Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the new coronavirus?",
      info: `No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria.
	    The new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus and, therefore, antibiotics should 
            not be used as a means of prevention or treatment.
	    However, if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive antibiotics 
	    because bacterial co-infection is possible.`,

	     appropriate care to relieve and treat symptoms, and those with severe illness 
	     should receive optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under 
	     investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. WHO is helping to
