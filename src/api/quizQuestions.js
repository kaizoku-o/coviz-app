      question: "Does the novel coronavirus only seriously affects older people?",
      info:`While statistically older people are more severely affected that is skewed by the fact that 
	    they are part of the population that have pre-existing medical conditions. 
	    The fact here is that the COVID-19 affects anyone with pre-existing medical conditions.
	    People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Older people, and
	    people with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease)
	    appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus.
 	    WHO advises people of all ages to take steps to protect themselves from the virus,
	    for example by following good hand hygiene and good respiratory hygiene.`,
